# Exercise 4: external data sets: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Use the `read.csv()` functoin to read the data from the `data/gates_money.csv`
# file into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv()`
# Be sure to set your working directory in RStudio, and do NOT treat strings as 
# factors!

setwd("d:/Education/UW/Informatics/INFO201/book-exercises/chapter-10-exercises/exercise-4/")
grants <- read.csv("data/gates_money.csv")

# Use the View function to look at the loaded data

View(grants)

# Create a variable `organization` that contains the `organization` column of 
# the dataset

organization <- as.vector(grants$organization)

# Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()` 
# function. 
# This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!

is.vector(organization)

## Now you can ask some interesting questions about the dataset

# What was the mean grant value?

print(mean(grants$total_amount, na.rm = TRUE))

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?

print(max(grants$total_amount))

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?

print(min(grants$total_amount))

# Which organization received the largest grant?

print(grants[grants$total_amount == max(grants$total_amount), "organization"])

# Which organization received the smallest grant?

print(grants[grants$total_amount == min(grants$total_amount), "organization"])

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?

print(nrow(grants[grants$start_year == 2010, ]))
